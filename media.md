Doctors for Justice in LTC is a coalition of health care professionals that work throughout the province who are ashamed at the failures in the private LTC system and its abhorrent impact on the lives of Seniors, their families, and the community at large.


Our open letter was released on January 26, 2021. It was a public letter directed to the leadership in the Province and Country.

You can follow our work on Twitter at [@Docs4LTCJustice](https://twitter.com/Docs4LTCJustice).
